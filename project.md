🚀 Assignment: Careers Page Builder
A. The Assignment 🧠
Companies using our ATS want their Careers page to match their brand, tell their story, and make it effortless for candidates to discover and apply to open roles — especially on mobile.
You’ll build a small product that helps Recruiters create branded Careers pages for their company — and lets Candidates browse open roles from those pages.
⏰Timeline
You can finish this in ~6–8 focused hours. The 7-day window is flexible to let you work at your own pace.
💡Inspiration
Before you start, explore how some companies tell their story:
https://apply.workable.com/careers/#jobs
https://apply.workable.com/gbg
https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/adtucon
Notice how each page feels on-brand, simple, and easy to browse — that’s the kind of experience your product should help Recruiters build for their companies.
👥Who Uses It
User
What they do
Page URLs
Recruiter
Logs in, customizes their company’s Careers page, and shares it publicly
/login, /company-slug/edit, /company-slug/preview
Candidate
Reads about the company and explores open jobs
/<company-slug>/careers
You (ATS Platform)
Build the system that allows many companies to manage their own Careers pages

🧩 What You’ll Build
Recruiters should be able to:
Set brand theme (colors, banner, logo, culture video).
Add, remove, or reorder content sections like About Us, Life at Company, etc.
Preview how the page will look before publishing.
Save settings — each company’s data stored separately.
Share their company’s public Careers link.
👉 Focus on helping recruiters easily build and customize their company Careers page — with clear, usable controls.
Candidates can:
Learn about the company through the Careers page.
Browse open jobs with filters (Location, Job Type) and search by Job Title.
Experience a clean, mobile-friendly, and accessible UI (labels, contrast, keyboard focus).
See an SEO-ready page (crawlable HTML, meta tags, structured data).
👉 You don’t need to build the job application flow — just the browsing experience.

✅ Submission Checklist
Keep everything clear, concise, and easy to follow.
GitHub repo with working code and sample data
Production live link (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)
Tech Spec.md — assumptions, architecture, schema, and test plan. DON’T Write this with AI.
README.md — how to run, what you built, improvement plan, and step-by-step user guide DON’T Write this with AI.
AGENT_LOG.md — Short notes on how you used AI tools, e.g., prompts, refinements, and learnings. (DON’T Write this with AI.
Demo video (≤5 min) — short walkthrough of your app
📤 How to Submit
Once your assignment is complete, please submit your links through the official Whitecarrot submission portal:
👉 Open Submission Portal
Enter your email address, then fill in the following details:
Google Drive Link – upload a ZIP file of your repository (including working code, sample data, and a clear README with setup steps)

Demo Video Link – a short walkthrough (≤ 5 minutes)
Double-check that all your links are publicly accessible before submitting.
C. Bonus Guidelines 💰
💡 Use your imagination — there’s no single “right” answer here. You’re free to approach the problem your own way, make assumptions, and design a solution that feels practical, scalable, and delightful to use.
Use AI tools at every phase — for brainstorming, UI design, and coding.
Show us how you worked with AI, where it helped, and how you improved its output.
Write clean, maintainable code following best practices — your next interview will include a short live deep-dive into your code, where you may fix or enhance something.
Focus on delivering a working, usable prototype that feels cohesive and complete — something you’d confidently demo to a real customer.
💭 Key Design Questions
How will you store data for each company separately?
How can recruiters easily build and customize their page?
How will edits safely update the page?
How can candidates browse jobs smoothly?
How does your design adapt across devices?
How would you scale if hundreds of companies used it?
Use any stack you prefer. Leverage design, prototyping, and AI-powered dev tools to move faster.  You can use free-tier platforms like Supabase or Neon.tech for your database.
🚀 Final Note
We care more about how you think than how perfect your code is — so take creative risks, experiment, and show us how you’d build in the real world.
 Build something you’d proudly demo. Good luck! 🚀
